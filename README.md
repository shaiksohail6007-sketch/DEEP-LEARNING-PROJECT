#Deep Learning Project, where the objective is to build a functional deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow. Deep learning plays a transformative role in today’s technology landscape by enabling machines to learn directly from images, text, sound, and more. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how neural networks can be trained to classify images accurately using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, one of the most popular benchmark datasets in the deep learning domain.

This task includes model development, training, evaluation, visualization of accuracy and loss graphs, and testing the model on unseen data. The result is a complete working deep learning pipeline, suitable for real-world AI applications.

To preprocess the data for neural network training.
To build, compile, and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
To evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
To visualize training results through plots.
To test predictions on random sample images.

Dataset Used — MNIST
Contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0–9).
Each image is 28 × 28 grayscale.
Pre-split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
A standard dataset for testing vision models.

Model Architecture
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to its strong image-processing capabilities.
Key layers include:
Conv2D layers for feature extraction
MaxPooling2D to reduce dimensionality
Flatten to convert images to a 1D vector
Dense layers for classification
Softmax output layer for digit prediction (0–9)
The model is compiled using:
loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'
optimizer = 'adam'
metrics = ['accuracy']
Training & Evaluation
During training:
Model learns patterns from handwritten digits
Training accuracy and validation accuracy improve every epoch
A graph of accuracy vs. epoch shows performance growth
Loss graph indicates how well the model is learning
Final evaluation is done on 10,000 test images, resulting in:
 Test Accuracy: ~97–99%
(depending on environment & randomness)

Visualization & Predictions
The code displays:
Model accuracy graph
Model loss graph
Visualization of sample predictions such as:
Predicted: 7
Predicted: 2
Predicted: 1
Predicted: 0
Predicted: 4
Predicted: 1
These outputs verify the model’s ability to correctly classify unseen images.
